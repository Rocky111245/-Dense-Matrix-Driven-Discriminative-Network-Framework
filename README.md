#  Dense Matrix-Driven Discriminative Neural Network Framework
This is a versatile neural framework that is custom made by me from scratch that harnesses the fundamental principles of mathematics to provide an efficient and robust platform for deep learning. Built upon a foundation of core mathematical operations, MathCoreNet features its own autograd engine, enabling seamless differentiation and efficient training of neural networks. Developed exclusively in C and C++, this framework empowers users to create, train, and deploy sophisticated neural models with ease. With a strong focus on computational efficiency and mathematical rigor, MathCoreNet represents a groundbreaking approach to neural network development, driving innovation in the field of deep learning.

Still under development.
