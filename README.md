#  Dense Matrix-Driven Discriminative Neural Network Framework
This is a versatile Deep Neural Network Framework that is custom made by me from scratch that harnesses the fundamental principles of mathematics to provide an efficient and robust platform for deep learning. Built upon a foundation of core mathematical operations, this framework features its own gradient calculation engine which does not use a Directed Acyclic Graph like traditional frameworks, enabling seamless differentiation and efficient training of neural networks whilst adding educational value. Developed exclusively in C and C++, this framework empowers users to create, train, and deploy sophisticated neural models with ease. With a strong focus on computational efficiency and mathematical rigor and education of mathematics underlying neural networks, this framework represents a unique approach to neural network development, driving innovation in the field of deep learning.

Still under development.
